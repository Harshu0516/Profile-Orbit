## 1️⃣ Backend (Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB)
(A) User Authentication (JWT)
Implement login/signup with JWT.
Allow OAuth login (Google, GitHub, etc.) for easy onboarding.
(B) Fetching Data from Platforms
APIs →  official APIs for platforms like LeetCode, CodeForces, and CodeChef.
Scraping →  Puppeteer for platforms without APIs (like GeeksforGeeks).
CSV Uploads → Create an API route to handle CSV parsing and data storage.
(C) Data Storage (MongoDB)
Store user profile details & coding activity.


## 2️⃣ Frontend (React.js + Chart.js)
User Dashboard → Shows problem-solving history, contest participation, and rankings.
Charts & Graphs →  Chart.js/ for visual analytics.
Leaderboards & Comparisons → Allow users to compare their stats with others.
Dark Mode + Responsive UI for better experience.


## 3️⃣ Next Steps
✅ Step 1: Set up the backend with JWT authentication.
✅ Step 2: Create APIs to fetch data from LeetCode, CodeForces, etc.
✅ Step 3: Implement scraping (Puppeteer/Cheerio) for GFG.
✅ Step 4: Develop frontend dashboard with React + Chart.js.
